# MongoDBApp

<!-- Now that you've had a chance to connect to MongoDB via shell and create some entries, we will learn how to access the database programmatically from a Node.js application. Follow the instructions in the QuickStart Guide for the MongoDB Node.js Driver to create a new Node app.

HERE IS THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE QUICKSTART GUIDE FOR THE MongoDB Node.js LINK: 
http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.0/quick-start/quick-start/

NOTE:

If you have trouble with the following step from the QuickStart Guide:

3. Install and start a mongod process.

mongod --dbpath=/data

Go ahead and skip it since you have already set this up in the previous lesson.

Instead of using copy/paste in all the provided code to insert and query for simple documents, we highly recommend you to put code up on a separate monitor and type out each code snippet that way you start to understand and digest more of it. It will obviously take longer, but adopting this practice will definitely be much more beneficial for understanding and retention and will save time in the long run.

For today, all you need to do is follow along exactly with the steps in the QuickStart Guide. When you have finished, your code should include copies of the functions, each worth 1 point:

insertDocuments
findDocuments
updateDocument
removeDocument
indexCollection

Your submission should also include the final version of the code to connect to MongoDB and invoke the  insertDocuments and  indexCollection functions (1 point). -->
